# Hobby-ever 

See  **CS179 final_report.pdf**  for details

Hobby-ever is a web app aims at helping individuals learn skills and interests freely. It is an Interest-oriented community, skill-exchange system, and self-improve platform.

### abstraction
we have established an Interest-oriented community helping individuals share their skills and learn new skills with strangers with talents. 
 
In our visual community, we will provide these functions:
- Login and Registration:
- User Profile
- Calendar
- Matching Paired-Users
- Searching Paired-Users
- Rating Paired-Users
- Displaying Course Lists
- Uploading and Watching Short Videos
- Online Chatting Room
 
The main challenges of the project are implementing the online chatting function and Interacting with the backend database and the backend server. And what is gratifying is that we finally solved these problems.
The innovation of the project is that we have used visual currency to attract more users to show their talents and communicate with others. And we have also used short videos to make our system more attractive and diverse.
Our project mainly developed based on Html + CSS + Javascript + Firebase. There are about 20,000 lines of codes in total.
